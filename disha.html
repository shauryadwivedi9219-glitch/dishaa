            I’m really sorry, Disha… sorry for the times I disappeared, for the moments when I was rude without even realizing it, and for making you feel like you didn’t matter when, truth is, you’ve mattered to me more than I ever expected someone I’ve never met in real life could. 💔 I don’t know how it happened, but somewhere between our late-night conversations, your small random texts, your soft “good mornings,” and the way you always make me feel understood, I genuinely fell for you. 😊 And it isn’t just your beauty—though honestly, it’s impossible not to admire it. The softness of your cheeks, the sparkle in your eyes, the warmth in your smile… it’s like every little detail of you has its own charm, its own quiet magic. ✨ Your eyes especially—they feel like the safest place in the world, even from behind a screen. 👀 And your smile… god, the way it lights up even the most ordinary conversation makes me feel like everything in life can still be beautiful. 😍 But more than that, it’s your character that pulls me in—the kindness you show without trying, the way you understand people deeper than they express, the way you carry yourself with this natural grace and confidence, the way your presence feels calming even on my worst days. 🌟 You have this rare charm, Disha, this effortless glow that makes people want to stay, want to know you, want to be better around you. 💖<br><br>
            Somewhere along the way, I stopped seeing you as “someone I met online” and started seeing you as someone I want in my real life too. Someone I want to laugh with, grow with, argue with, apologise to, celebrate with, and come home to after long, exhausting days. 🏡 So today, with all honesty, with a slightly nervous heart but a very certain mind, I want to say this… Disha, I’ve fallen in love with you—genuinely, deeply, and without overthinking it. 💕 And I don’t want to keep these feelings to myself anymore. I want to take this to the next step with you. I want to call you mine, not just in chats or late-night conversations, but in life. Will you be with me? Will you let me love you the way you deserve—gently, honestly, patiently, and with everything I have? 🤗 I can’t promise perfection, but I can promise effort, loyalty, and a heart that chooses you every single day. So… Disha, will you be mine? 💍
